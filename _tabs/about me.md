Hi!

I'm James Minardi, a graduating Computer Engineering student passionate about developing innovative and cutting-edge solutions for computer graphics, GPU & ML architecture, and embedded systems. I have gained a solid foundation in these areas through my coursework, personal projects, and professional experience. I am actively applying for positions in computer graphics following my graduation in Spring 2025.

I've been involved with everything from CPU, GPU, and ML hardware design and implementation, to graphics drivers and software applications that you can read about here on my website.

In my free time I enjoy playing volleyball, riding my motorcycle, listening to music, and drinking coffee :)

#### Garmin Internship - Summer 2024
During my senior year, I interned at Garmin, where I developed and maintained multithreaded Vulkan and OpenGL graphics libraries for next-generation flight decks and displays. This was a great learning experience, and I was able to showcase my skills in computer graphics from previous projects and coursework.

#### Musco Internship - Summer 2023
During my junior year, I interned at Musco. I was on the emerging technologies R&D team to bring affordable AI tech to the sports market. My time there was spent creating the foundation for an AI and video processing platform to unify new and existing products.

#### BAE Systems Co-op - Summer 2022 - Spring 2023
During my sophomore year, I co-oped at BAE Systems, Inc. where I developed and tested advanced processing software for real-time embedded GPS receivers. This was my first working experience to be able to apply everything I've learned in the classroom thus far to a production product, and was an important moment in my education and growth as an engineer.
