# About Me

As an experienced Computer Engineering student at Iowa State University, I am passionate about developing innovative and cutting-edge solutions for computer graphics, and GPU & ML Architecture. I have gained a solid foundation in these areas through my coursework, personal projects, and professional experience.

I've been involved with everything from CPU, GPU, and machine learning hardware architectural design and implementation to graphics drivers to software applications primarily in OpenGL.

In my free time I enjoy playing volleyball, riding my motorcycle, listening to music, and drinking coffee :)

Thank you for checking out my site!
