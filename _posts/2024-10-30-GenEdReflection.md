# Reflecting on my general education at Iowa State University

I took several general education courses throughout my education that gave me a unique perspective on solving engineering problems. These courses helped my understanding of cultural, historical, and social contexts. Specifically, courses like Russia Today, American Sign Language, And U.S. History gave me the knowledge and skills to solve engineering problems and address societal concerns.

RUS 375: Russia Today gave me insight into the cultural, political, and economic evolution of modern Russia, which challenged my biases. I learned how the transition of their economic system disrupted Russian society, resulting in poverty and social instability. These lessons were important to my understanding of engineering problems from a societal and political context, especially when addressing global issues.

ASL 101 & 102: American Sign Language showed the importance of inclusion and cultural sensitivity, directly impacting my personal and professional growth. I was introduced to Deaf culture and the barriers those with disabilities face every day. My senior design project is scoped around assistive technologies, and Iâ€™ve focussed on creating a user-centered product that considers all individuals as a result. My experiences as a Resident Assistant also helped reinforce the importance of inclusivity in the workplace.

HIST 221 & 222: U.S. History gave me a complete understanding of the historical evolution of the United States, from industrialization to modern society. These courses showed how advancements in technology often have consequences like labor inequality, environmental degradation, and social unrest. For example, studying the Industrial Revolution showed the importance of balancing advancement with sustainability and ethical practices, which are directly applicable to engineering problems like the development of renewable energy.

Overall, the general education courses I took helped me understand the importance of considering the ethical, cultural, historical, and social context of engineering problems. These courses expanded my perspective and allow me to contribute to a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive society through engineering.
